                <p><strong>Job Title</strong>: Customer Care Executive</p>
                <p>I started work at Clanwilliam Health during the Pandemic, the job provided me with a great deal of teamworking and IT support experience. I would say that my proudest moment so far would have to be having ~20 cases solved in a day within
                    my first month of working. My managers would say that I am extremely quick to pick up new topics and that I am hardworking</p>

                <h3>Software Tutoring</h3>
                <p>19/05/2020 -> Present</p>
                <p>I began tutoring a few of my less software inclined friends with Python for various code based modules they had undertaken in college or in online courses. All of my pupils achieved 80+ in their final grades and I gained the experience
                    of helping others understand my code and learned how to express my ideas in plain language for easier understanding</p>

                <p><strong>Job Title</strong>: Associate Systems Developer</p>
                <p>During my 3rd year in ITSligo I was given a work placement opportunity with Pramerica in Donegal. I was given a project to create a full stack web application for inhouse inventory management using Angular, SQL, and .Net Core.</p>

                <p><strong>Course Title</strong>: Computing in Software Development</p>
                <p>Before college I had already had a passion for learning. But, during my time in ITSligo I developed a love for software development. In my course I had a slew of modules including Web Development, Database administation, Software engineering,
                    Professsional development, Cloud architecture and Machine Learning. I completed my fourth year at ITSligo with a 2:1 Honors Bachelor degree</p>
