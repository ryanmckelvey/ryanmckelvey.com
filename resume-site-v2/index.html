                        <p>I started work at Clanwilliam Health during the Pandemic, the job provided me with a great deal of teamworking and IT support experience. I would say that my proudest moment so far would have to be having ~20 cases solved in a

                        <p>I began tutoring a few of my less software inclined friends with Python for various code based modules they had undertaken in college or in online courses. All of my pupils achieved 80+ in their final grades and I gained the experience
                            of helping others understand my code and learned how to express my ideas in plain language for easier understanding</p>

                        <p>Before college I had already had a passion for learning. But, during my time in ITSligo I developed a love for software development. In my course I had a slew of modules including Web Development, Database administation, Software
                            engineering, Professsional development, Cloud architecture and Machine Learning. I completed my fourth year at ITSligo with a 2:1 Honors Bachelor degree</p>
